There are several different types of rectal laxatives and they work in different ways. Since directions for use are different for each type, it is important to know which one you are taking. The different types of rectal laxatives include: Carbon dioxide-releasing Carbon dioxide-releasing laxatives (e.g., potassium bitartrate and sodium bicarbonate) are suppositories that encourage bowel movements by forming carbon dioxide, a gas. This gas pushes against the intestinal wall, causing contractions that move along the stool mass. Hyperosmotic Hyperosmotic laxatives (e.g., glycerin; sodium phosphates) draw water into the bowel from surrounding body tissues. This provides a soft stool mass and increased bowel action. Lubricant Mineral oil coats the bowel and the stool mass with a waterproof film. This keeps moisture in the stool. The stool remains soft and its passage is made easier. Stimulants Stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl; senna), also known as contact laxatives, act on the intestinal wall. They increase the muscle contractions that move along the stool mass. Stool softeners (emollients) Stool softeners (emollient laxatives—e.g., docusate) encourage bowel movements by helping liquids mix into the stool and prevent dry, hard stool masses. This type of laxative has been said not to cause a bowel movement but instead allows the patient to have a bowel movement without straining. Rectal laxatives may provide relief in a number of situations such as: before giving birth. for a few days after giving birth. preparation for examination or surgery. to aid in developing normal bowel function following a period of poor eating habits or a lack of physical exercise (glycerin suppositories only). following surgery when straining should be avoided. constipation caused by other medicines.

Since children cannot usually describe their symptoms very well, they should be checked by a doctor before being given a laxative. The child may have a condition that needs other treatment. If so, laxatives will not help and may even cause unwanted effects or make the condition worse. Also, weakness, increased sweating, and convulsions (seizures) may be especially likely to occur in children receiving enemas or rectal solutions, since they may be more sensitive than adults to their effects.

High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure also may increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled. Hydralazine works by relaxing blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

They appear to work by reducing the production of fluid in the eye. This lowers the pressure in the eye. These medicines are available only with your doctor's prescription. This product is available in the following dosage forms: Suspension Solution Gel Forming Solution Back to top Before Using Allergies Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Pediatric Infants may be especially sensitive to the effects of ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This may increase the chance of side effects during treatment. Geriatric Elderly people are especially sensitive to the effects of ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents. If too much medicine is absorbed into the body, the chance of side effects during treatment may be increased. Pregnancy Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be absorbed into the body. These medicines have not been studied in pregnant women. Studies in animals have not shown that betaxolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, or timolol causes birth defects. However, high doses of levobetaxolol given by mouth to pregnant rabbits have been shown to cause birth defects in rabbit babies, and very large doses of carteolol given by mouth to pregnant rats have been shown to cause wavy ribs in rat babies. In addition, some studies in animals have shown that beta-adrenergic blocking agents increase the chance of death in the animal fetus. Before using ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents, make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant. Breastfeeding Betaxolol and timolol, and maybe other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, when taken by mouth, may pass into the breast milk. Since ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be absorbed into the body, they, too, may pass into the breast milk. However, it is not known whether ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents pass into the breast milk, and these medicines have not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies. Drug Interactions Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking any of these medicines, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive. Using medicines in this class with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines. Albuterol Ceritinib Clonidine Cobicistat Crizotinib Darunavir Desvenlafaxine Diltiazem Dronedarone Duloxetine Epinephrine Escitalopram Fenoldopam Fingolimod Fluoxetine Formoterol Indacaterol Iohexol Lacosamide Landiolol Levalbuterol Olodaterol Oxymetazoline Paroxetine Ponesimod Rivastigmine Salmeterol Sertraline Terbutaline Verapamil Vilanterol Other Interactions Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco. Other Medical Problems The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially: Allergic reactions, severe (history of)—Use of an ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agent may reduce the effectiveness of the medicine (epinephrine) used to treat severe allergic reactions. Asthma (or history of), chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other lung disease—Severe breathing problems, including death due to bronchospasm (spasm of the bronchial tubes), have been reported in patients with asthma following use of some ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents (carteolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, and timolol). Although most often not a problem, the possibility of wheezing or troubled breathing also exists with betaxolol and levobetaxolol. Type 2 diabetes mellitus or Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may cover up some signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), such as fast heartbeat and trembling, although they do not cover up other signs, such as dizziness or sweating. Heart or blood vessel disease—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may decrease heart activity. Myasthenic conditions—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may worsen muscle weakness caused by diseases such as myasthenia gravis. Overactive thyroid—Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may cover up certain signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid). Suddenly stopping the use of ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may cause a sudden and dangerous increase in thyroid symptoms. Back to top Proper Use To use: First, wash your hands. With the middle finger, apply pressure to the inside corner of the eye (and continue to apply pressure for 1 or 2 minutes after the medicine has been placed in the eye). This is especially important if the ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agent is used to treat infants and children. Tilt the head back and with the index finger of the same hand, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to form a pouch. Drop the medicine into the pouch and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed. Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them. To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed. If you are using levobunolol with the compliance cap (C Cap): Before using the eye drops for the first time, make sure the number 1 or the correct day of the week appears in the window on the cap. Remove the cap and use the eye drops as directed. Replace the cap. Holding the cap between your thumb and forefinger, rotate the bottle until the cap clicks to the next position. This will tell you the time of your next dose. After every dose, rotate the bottle until the cap clicks to the position that tells you the time of your next dose. If you are using the gel-forming timolol solution: Before using the eye drops each time, turn the closed bottle upside-down and shake once. If you use other eye drops in addition to the gel-forming solution, the other eye drops should be used first, then wait at least ten minutes before using this medicine. If you wear soft contact lenses and your eye drops contain benzalkonium chloride: Remove your contacts before you use your eye drops. Wait for fifteen minutes after using the eye drops before putting your contacts in your eyes. Use this medicine only as directed . Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects. Dosing The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine. For betaxolol, carteolol, or metipranolol For ophthalmic dosage form: For glaucoma: Adults and older children—Topical, to the conjunctiva, 1 drop two times a day. Infants and younger children—Dose must be determined by the doctor. For levobetaxolol For ophthalmic dosage form: For glaucoma: Adults—Topical, to the conjunctiva, 1 drop two times a day. Children—Use and dose must be determined by the doctor. For levobunolol or timolol For ophthalmic dosage form: For glaucoma: Adults and older children—Topical, to the conjunctiva, 1 drop one or two times a day. Infants and younger children—Dose must be determined by the doctor. Missed Dose Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions. If you miss a dose of this medicine and your dosing schedule is: One dose a day—Use the missed dose as soon as possible. However, if you do not remember the missed dose until the next day, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses. More than one dose a day—Use the missed dose as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses. If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor. Storage Keep out of the reach of children. Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing. Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed. Store levobetaxolol in an upright position. Back to top Precautions Your doctor should check your eye pressure at regular visits to make certain that your glaucoma is being controlled. Contact your physician immediately if you are having eye surgery, you experience trauma to your eye, or you develop an eye infection to determine if you should continue to use your present container of eye drops. For a short time after you use this medicine, your vision may be blurred. Make sure your vision is clear before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not able to see well. Before you have any kind of surgery, dental treatment, or emergency treatment, tell the medical doctor or dentist in charge that you are using this medicine . Using an ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agent during this time may cause an increased risk of side effects. For diabetic patients: Ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may affect blood sugar levels. They may also cover up some signs of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), such as trembling or increase in pulse rate or blood pressure. However, other signs of low blood sugar, such as dizziness or sweating, are not affected. If you notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests or if you have any questions, check with your doctor. Some ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents (betaxolol, carteolol, and metipranolol) may cause your eyes to become more sensitive to light than they are normally. Wearing sunglasses and avoiding too much exposure to bright light may help lessen the discomfort. Back to top Side Effects Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.

They are also used to treat gastric ulcers and for some conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison disease, in which the stomach produces too much acid. In over-the-counter (OTC) strengths, these medicines are used to relieve and/or prevent heartburn, acid indigestion, and sour stomach. H2-blockers may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor. H2-blockers work by decreasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach. H2-blockers are available both over-the-counter (OTC) and with your doctor's prescription. Limited testing has found unacceptable levels of a probable human carcinogen, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in some ranitidine medicines. This product is available in the following dosage forms: Tablet Solution Powder for Suspension Capsule Back to top Before Using Allergies Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Pediatric This medicine has been tested in children and, in effective doses, has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults when used for short periods of time. Geriatric Confusion and dizziness may be especially likely to occur in elderly patients, who are usually more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of H2-blockers. Pregnancy H2-blockers have not been studied in pregnant women. In animal studies, famotidine and ranitidine have not been shown to cause birth defects or other problems. However, one study in rats suggested that cimetidine may affect male sexual development. More studies are needed to confirm this. Also, studies in rabbits with very high doses have shown that nizatidine causes miscarriages and low birth weights. Make sure your doctor knows if you are pregnant or if you may become pregnant before taking H2-blockers. Breastfeeding Cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine pass into the breast milk and may cause unwanted effects, such as decreased amounts of stomach acid and increased excitement, in the nursing baby. It may be necessary for you to take another medicine or to stop breast-feeding during treatment. Be sure you have discussed the risks and benefits of the medicine with your doctor. Drug Interactions Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Back to top Precautions Limited testing has found unacceptable levels of a probable human carcinogen, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), in some ranitidine medicines Some tests may be affected by this medicine. Tell the doctor in charge that you are taking this medicine before: You have any skin tests for allergies. You have any tests to determine how much acid your stomach produces. Remember that certain medicines, such as aspirin, and certain foods and drinks (e.g., citrus products, carbonated drinks) irritate the stomach and may make your problem worse. Cigarette smoking tends to decrease the effect of H2-blockers by increasing the amount of acid produced by the stomach. This is more likely to affect the stomach's nighttime production of acid. While taking H2-blockers, stop smoking completely, or at least do not smoke after taking the last dose of the day. Drinking alcoholic beverages while taking an H2-receptor antagonist has been reported to increase the blood levels of alcohol. You should consult your health care professional for guidance. Check with your doctor if your ulcer pain continues or gets worse. Back to top Side Effects Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.

High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Azilsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to tighten. As a result, azilsartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

The low-dose progestins for contraception are used to prevent pregnancy. Other names for progestin-only oral contraceptives are minipills and progestin-only pills (POPs). Progestins can prevent fertilization by preventing a woman's egg from fully developing. Also, progestins cause changes at the opening of the uterus, such as thickening of the cervical mucus. This makes it hard for the partner's sperm to reach the egg. The fertilization of the woman's egg with her partner's sperm is less likely to occur while she is taking, receiving, or using a progestin, but it can occur. Even so, the progestins make it harder for the fertilized egg to become attached to the walls of the uterus, making it difficult to become pregnant. No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Studies show that fewer than 1 of each 100 women become pregnant during the first year of use after correctly receiving the injection on time. Fewer than 10 of each 100 women who take progestins correctly by mouth for contraception become pregnant during the first year of use . Methods that do not work as well include condoms, diaphragms, or spermicides. Discuss with your doctor what your options are for birth control. Progestin contraceptives are available only with your doctor's prescription. Importance Of Diet Make certain your doctor knows if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sodium or low-sugar diet.

Pediatric Progestins have been used by teenagers and have not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than they do in adults.

Back to top Proper Use To make the use of a progestin as safe and reliable as possible, you should understand how and when to take it and what effects may be expected. Progestins for contraception usually come with patient directions. Read them carefully before taking or using this medicine. Progestins do not protect a woman from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The use of latex (rubber) condoms or abstinence is recommended for protection from these diseases. Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered . To do so may increase the chance of side effects. Try to take the medicine at the same time each day to reduce the possibility of side effects and to allow it to work better. When using levonorgestrel tablet dosage form for emergency contraception : The tablets may be taken at any time during the menstrual cycle. When using medroxyprogesterone injection dosage form for contraception : Your injection is given by a health care professional every 3 months. To stop using medroxyprogesterone injection for contraception, simply do not have another injection. Full protection from pregnancy begins immediately if you receive the first injection within the first 5 days of your menstrual period or within 5 days after delivering a baby if you will not be breast-feeding. If you are going to breast-feed, you may have to wait for 6 weeks from your delivery date before receiving your first injection. If you follow this schedule, you do not need to use another form of birth control. Protection from that one injection ends at 3 months. You will need another injection every 3 months to have full protection from becoming pregnant. However, if the injection is given later than 5 days from the first day of your last menstrual period, you will need to use another method of birth control as directed by your doctor. When using an oral progestin dosage form : Take a tablet every 24 hours each day of the year. Taking the medicine at the same time each day helps to reduce the possibility of side effects and makes it work as expected. Taking your tablet 3 hours late is the same as missing a dose and can cause the medicine to not work properly. Keep the tablets in the container in which you received them to help you to keep track of your dosage schedule. When switching from estrogen and progestin oral contraceptives, you should take the first dose of the progestin-only contraceptive the next day after the last active pill of the estrogen and progestin oral contraceptive has been taken. This means you will not take the last 7 days (placebo or nonactive pills) of a 28-day cycle of the estrogen and progestin oral contraceptive pack. You will begin a new pack of progestin-only birth control pills on the 22nd day. Also, when switching, full protection from pregnancy begins after 48 hours if the first dose of the progestin-only contraceptive is taken on the first day of the menstrual period. If the birth control is begun on other days, full protection may begin 3 weeks after you begin taking the medicine for the first time. You should use a second method of birth control for at least the first 3 weeks to ensure full protection. You are not fully protected if you miss pills. The chances of your getting pregnant are greater with each pill that is missed. Follow your doctor's orders to schedule the proper time to receive an injection of progestins for contraception. Dosing The dose medicines in this class will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of these medicines. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine. For levonorgestrel For oral dosage form (tablets): For emergency contraception for preventing pregnancy: Adults and teenagers—The first dose of 0.75 milligram should be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours of intercourse. The second dose must be taken 12 hours later. For medroxyprogesterone For muscular injection dosage form For preventing pregnancy: Adults and teenagers—150 milligrams injected into a muscle in the upper arm or in the buttocks every three months (13 weeks). For subcutaneous injection dosage form For preventing pregnancy: Adults and teenagers—104 milligrams injected under the skin of the anterior thigh or abdomen every three months (12 to 14 weeks). For norethindrone For oral dosage form (tablets): For preventing pregnancy: Adults and teenagers—0.35 milligrams every 24 hours, beginning on the first day of your menstrual cycle whether menstrual bleeding begins or not. The first day of your menstrual cycle can be figured out by counting 28 days from the first day of your last menstrual cycle. For norgestrel For oral dosage form (tablets): For preventing pregnancy: Adults and teenagers—75 micrograms every 24 hours, beginning on the first day of your menstrual cycle whether menstrual bleeding occurs or not. The first day of your menstrual cycle can be figured out by counting 28 days from the first day of your last menstrual cycle. Missed Dose Call your doctor or pharmacist for instructions. For oral dosage form (tablets): When you miss 1 day's dose of oral tablets or are 3 hours or more late in taking your dose, many doctors recommend that you take the missed dose immediately, continue your normal schedule, and use another method of contraception for 2 days. This is different from what is done after a person misses a dose of birth control tablets that contain more than one hormone. For injection dosage form: If you miss having your next injection and it has been longer than 13 weeks since your last injection, your doctor may want you to stop receiving the medicine. Use another method of birth control until your period begins or until your doctor determines that you are not pregnant. If your doctor has other directions, follow that advice. Any time you miss a menstrual period within 45 days after a missed or delayed dose you will need to be tested for a possible pregnancy. Storage Keep out of the reach of children. Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing. Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed. Back to top Precautions It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits . This will allow your dosage to be adjusted to your changing needs, and will allow any unwanted effects to be detected. These visits are usually every 12 months when you are taking progestins by mouth for birth control. If you are receiving the medroxyprogesterone injection for contraception, a physical exam is needed only every 12 months, but you need an injection every 3 months. Your doctor will also want to check you for any bone development or growth problems, especially if you are a teenager or young adult. Progestins may cause dizziness in some people . Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are not alert. It is possible that certain doses of progestins may cause a temporary thinning of the bones by changing your hormone balance. It is important that your doctor know if you have an increased risk of osteoporosis. Some things that can increase your risk for osteoporosis include cigarette smoking, abusing alcohol, taking or drinking large amounts of caffeine, and having a family history of osteoporosis or easily broken bones. Some medicines, such as steroids (cortisone-like medicines) or anticonvulsants (seizure medicines), can also cause thinning of the bones. It is especially important that you tell your doctor about any of these risk factors if you are taking Depo-Provera® Contraceptive Injection or Depo-SubQ Provera® 104 . These contraceptives may cause a loss of bone mineral density. Your doctor may replace these contraceptives with a different one. Vaginal bleeding of various amounts may occur between your regular menstrual periods during the first 3 months of use. This is not unusual and does not mean you should stop the medicine. This is sometimes called spotting when the bleeding is slight, or breakthrough bleeding when it is heavier. If this occurs, continue on your regular dosing schedule. Check with your doctor : If vaginal bleeding continues for an unusually long time. If your menstrual period has not started within 45 days of your last period. Missed menstrual periods may occur. If you suspect a pregnancy, you should call your doctor immediately . If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor that you are taking a progestin. Progestins can change certain test results. The following medicines might reduce the effectiveness of progestins for contraception: Aminoglutethimide (e.g., Cytadren®) Carbamazepine (e.g., Tegretol®) Phenobarbital Phenytoin (e.g., Dilantin®) Rifabutin (e.g., Mycobutin®) Rifampin (e.g., Rifadin®) Sometimes your doctor may use these medicines with progestins for contraception, but the doctor will give you special directions to follow to make sure your progestin is working properly. In order to prevent pregnancy, use a second method of birth control together with the progestin when you also use a medicine that could reduce the effectiveness of the progestin. If you are using medroxyprogesterone injection for contraception, continue using a back-up method of birth control until you have your next injection, even if the medicine that affects contraceptives is discontinued. If you are using the oral tablets, continue using a back-up method of birth control for a full cycle (or 4 weeks), even if the medicine that affects contraceptives is discontinued. If you vomit your oral progestin-only contraceptive for any reason within a few hours after taking it, do not take another dose. Return to your regular dosing schedule and use an additional back-up method of birth control for 48 hours. If you are receiving levonorgestrel tablets for emergency contraception and vomiting occurs within 1 hour after taking either dose of the medicine, contact your physician to discuss whether the dose should be repeated. Back to top Side Effects Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.

This medicine is usually inserted into the vagina with an applicator. However, if you are pregnant, check with your doctor before using the applicator. To help clear up your infection completely, it is very important that you keep using this medicine for the full time of treatment , even if your symptoms begin to clear up after a few days.

Back to top Precautions If your symptoms do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor. Vaginal medicines usually will slowly work their way out of the vagina during treatment. To keep the medicine from soiling or staining your clothing, a sanitary napkin may be worn. Minipads, clean paper tissues, or paper diapers may also be used. However, the use of tampons is not recommended since they may soak up too much of the medicine. In addition, tampons may be more likely to slip out of the vagina if you use them during treatment with this medicine. To help clear up your infection completely and to help make sure it does not return, good health habits are also required . Wear cotton panties (or panties or pantyhose with cotton crotches) instead of synthetic (for example, nylon or rayon) underclothes. Wear only freshly washed underclothes. If you have any questions about this, check with your health care professional. Many vaginal infections are spread by sexual intercourse. The male sexual partner may carry the fungus or other organism in his reproductive tract. Therefore, it may be desirable that your partner wear a condom (prophylactic) during intercourse to keep the infection from returning. Also, it may be necessary for your partner to be treated at the same time you are being treated to avoid passing the infection back and forth. In addition, do not stop using this medicine if you have intercourse during treatment . Some patients who use vaginal medicines may prefer to use a douche for cleansing purposes before inserting the next dose of medicine. Some doctors recommend a vinegar and water or other douche. However, others do not recommend douching at all. If you do use a douche, do not overfill the vagina with douche solution . To do so may force the solution up into the uterus (womb) and may cause inflammation or infection. Also, do not douche if you are pregnant since this may harm the fetus . If you have any questions about this or which douche products are best for you, check with your health care professional.

Dutasteride can cause birth defects in male fetuses. Dutasteride is used alone or in combination with tamsulosin (Flomax®) to treat men who have symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland, which is also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. As the prostate gland enlarges, certain muscles in the gland may become tight and get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems with urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely. Dutasteride blocks the action of an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme changes testosterone to another hormone that causes the prostate to grow. As a result, the size of the prostate is decreased. The effect of dutasteride lasts only as long as the medicine is taken. If it is stopped, the prostate begins to grow again.

When a man is sexually stimulated, his body's normal response is to increase blood flow to his penis to produce an erection. By controlling the enzyme, avanafil helps to maintain an erection after the penis is stroked by increasing blood flow to the penis. Without physical action to the penis, such as that occurring during sexual intercourse, avanafil will not work to cause an erection. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

It works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the virus. This vaccine does not protect you against German measles (Rubella). A separate immunization is needed for that type of measles. Measles (also known as coughing measles, hard measles, morbilli, red measles, rubeola, and ten-day measles) is an infection that is easily spread from one person to another. Infection with measles can lead to serious problems, such as pneumonia, ear infections, sinus problems, convulsions (seizures), brain damage, and possibly death. The risk of serious complications and death is greater for adults and infants than for children and teenagers. Immunization against measles is recommended for everyone 12 to 15 months of age and older. In addition, there may be special reasons why children from 6 months of age up to 12 months of age may also require measles vaccine. Immunization against measles is usually not recommended for infants up to 12 months of age, unless the risk of their getting a measles infection is high. This is because antibodies they received from their mothers before birth may interfere with the effectiveness of the vaccine. Children who were immunized against measles before 12 months of age should be immunized twice again. You can be considered to be immune to measles only if you received two doses of measles vaccine starting on or after your first birthday and have the medical record to prove it, if you have a doctor's diagnosis of a previous measles infection, or if you have had a blood test showing immunity to measles.

High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled. Atenolol is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to some nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart. Chlorthalidone is a diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps to lower blood pressure. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. This product is available in the following dosage forms: Tablet Back to top Before Using In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Pediatric Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of atenolol and chlorthalidone combination in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Geriatric Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatrics-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of atenolol and chlorthalidone combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require an adjustment of dosage in patients receiving atenolol and chlorthalidone combination.

High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of stroke and heart attack. Candesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking the action of a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, candesartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic (water pill). It reduces the amount of water in the body by increasing the flow of urine, which helps lower the blood pressure. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

{"url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/candesartan-oral-route/description/drg-20068192", "title": "Candesartan (oral route)", "content": "Brand Name US Brand Name Atacand Back to top Description Candesartan is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children 1 to 16 years of age. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Candesartan is also used to treat heart failure in adults and cut down on the number of hospital visits for heart problems. Candesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). It works by blocking the action of a substance in the body that causes the blood vessels to tighten. As a result, candesartan relaxes the blood vessels. This lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. This product is available in the following dosage forms: Tablet Back to top Before Using In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Pediatric Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of candesartan to treat hypertension in children 1 to 16 years of age. Use of candesartan to treat hypertension in newborn babies and infants up to 1 year of age is not recommended. No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of candesartan to treat heart failure in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

{"url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/aspirin-caffeine-and-dihydrocodeine-oral-route/description/drg-20095195", "title": "Aspirin, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine (oral route)", "content": "Brand Name US Brand Name Synalgos-DC Back to top Description Aspirin, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine combination is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain and reduce fever in patients. Caffeine is a CNS stimulant that is used together with pain relievers to increase their effect. It has also been used for migraine headaches. Dihydrocodeine belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. When dihydrocodeine is used for a long time or in large doses, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely. This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

Pediatric Use of aspirin, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine combination is not recommended in children 12 years of age or younger. Synalgos®-DC should not be used to relieve pain after surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids in children. Severe breathing problems and deaths have been reported in some children who received codeine after tonsil or adenoid surgery . Geriatric Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of aspirin, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related lung, liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving aspirin, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine combination in order to avoid potentially serious side effects.

Also, lying down for a while may relieve the dizziness or lightheadedness. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor right away. This medicine may cause bleeding in your stomach or intestines. This problem can happen without warning signs. This is more likely if you have had a stomach ulcer in the past, if you smoke or drink alcohol regularly, if you are over 60 years of age, are in poor health, or are using certain other medicines (eg, steroids or a blood thinner). Serious skin reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fixed drug eruption (FDE), and generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE) can occur during treatment with this medicine.

Some people change codeine to morphine more quickly than others. These individuals are called \"ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine\". Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing . These symptoms may indicate that you are an \"ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine\". As a result, there is too much morphine in the body and more side effects of morphine than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect. Do not give this medicine to: Children younger than 12 years of age. Children younger than 18 years of age who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids. Children 12 to 18 years of age who have a high risk for breathing problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung disease).

For nursing mothers taking this medicine : Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about taking codeine or about how this medicine may affect your baby. Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby. Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time. Check with your doctor, hospital emergency room, or local emergency services (eg, \"call 9-1-1\") right away if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention. If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of this medicine, get emergency help at once. Your doctor may also give naloxone to treat an overdose. Signs of an overdose include : cold, clammy skin, coughing that sometimes produces a pink frothy sputum, dark urine, difficult or trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, nausea or vomiting, pain in the upper stomach, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or yellow eyes or skin. Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using this medicine without first checking with your doctor .

Caffeine is a CNS stimulant that is used with pain relievers to increase their effect. It has also been used for migraine headaches. Codeine belongs to the group of medicine called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. When butalbital or codeine is used for a long time or in large doses, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects when you suddenly stop taking the medicine. In patients who get headaches, the first symptom of withdrawal may be new (rebound) headaches.

Some people change codeine to morphine more quickly than others. These individuals are called \"ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine\". Contact your doctor immediately if you experience extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing . These symptoms may indicate that you are an \"ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine\". As a result, there is too much morphine in the body and more side effects of morphine than usual. Children may be especially sensitive to this effect. Do not give this medicine to: Children younger than 12 years of age. Children younger than 18 years of age who have had surgery removal of tonsils or adenoids. Children 12 to 18 years of age who have a high risk for breathing problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung disease). If a nursing mother is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine, it could lead to a morphine overdose in the nursing baby and cause very serious side effects. For nursing mothers using this medicine : Talk to your doctor if you have any questions about using codeine or about how this medicine may affect your baby. Call your doctor if you become extremely tired and have difficulty caring for your baby. Your baby should generally nurse every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep for more than 4 hours at a time. Check with your doctor or hospital emergency room right away if your baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, difficulty breathing, or limpness. These may be symptoms of an overdose and need immediate medical attention. Aspirin may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have a rash, hives, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine.

{"url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/biotin-oral-route/description/drg-20062359", "title": "Biotin (oral route)", "content": "Brand Name US Brand Name Appearex Genadur Meribin Nail-ex Back to top Description Biotin supplements are used to prevent or treat biotin deficiency. Vitamins are compounds that you must have for growth and health. They are needed in only small amounts and are usually available in the foods that you eat. Biotin is necessary for formation of fatty acids and glucose, which are used as fuels by the body. It is also important for the metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates. A lack of biotin is rare. However, if it occurs it may lead to skin rash, loss of hair, high blood levels of cholesterol, and heart problems. Some conditions may increase your need for biotin. These include: Genetic disorder of biotin deficiency Seborrheic dermatitis in infants Surgical removal of the stomach Increased need for biotin should be determined by your health care professional. Claims that biotin supplements are effective in the treatment of acne, eczema (a type of skin disorder), or hair loss have not been proven. Biotin supplements are available without a prescription. Importance Of Diet For good health, it is important that you eat a balanced and varied diet. Follow carefully any diet program your health care professional may recommend. For your specific vitamin and/or mineral needs, ask your health care professional for a list of appropriate foods. If you think that you are not getting enough vitamins and/or minerals in your diet, you may choose to take a dietary supplement. Biotin is found in various foods, including liver, cauliflower, salmon, carrots, bananas, soy flour, cereals, and yeast. Biotin content of food is reduced by cooking and preserving. Vitamins alone will not take the place of a good diet and will not provide energy. Your body needs other substances found in food, such as protein, minerals, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamins themselves cannot work without the presence of other foods. The daily amount of biotin needed is defined in several different ways. For U.S.— Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are the amount of vitamins and minerals needed to provide for adequate nutrition in most healthy persons. RDAs for a given nutrient may vary depending on a person's age, sex, and physical condition (e.g., pregnancy). Daily Values (DVs) are used on food and dietary supplement labels to indicate the percent of the recommended daily amount of each nutrient that a serving provides. DVs replace the previous designation of United States Recommended Daily Allowances (USRDAs). For Canada— Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) are used to determine the amounts of vitamins, minerals, and protein needed to provide adequate nutrition and lessen the risk of chronic disease. Because lack of biotin is rare, there is no RDA or RNI for it. Normal daily recommended intakes for biotin are generally defined as follows: Infants and children— Birth to 3 years of age: 10 to 20 micrograms (mcg). 4 to 6 years of age: 25 mcg. 7 to 10 years of age: 30 mcg. Adolescents and adults— 30 to 100 mcg. This product is available in the following dosage forms: Capsule, Liquid Filled Tablet, Chewable Tablet Capsule Tablet, Disintegrating Back to top Before Using If you are taking this dietary supplement without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label.

Geriatric Problems in older adults have not been reported with intake of normal daily recommended amounts. Drug Interactions Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine. For oral dosage form (capsules or tablets): To prevent deficiency, the amount taken by mouth is based on normal daily recommended intakes: Adults and teenagers—30 to 100 micrograms (mcg) per day. Children 7 to 10 years of age—30 mcg per day. Children 4 to 6 years of age—25 mcg per day. Children birth to 3 years of age—10 to 20 mcg per day.

Missed Dose If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.
